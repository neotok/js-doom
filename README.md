Topdown Doom
============
A top down doom engine. Can display some maps at the moment, converted using the py-wad2json utility. 

NOTE: the maps must have GL NODES to be displayable at the moment.

Running
=======

Use python:

    python -m http.server

This runs the server on port 8000

Using rake:

    rake jasmine:headless

This runs the unit tests (very quickly), on the command line. Very handy when developing. You may need the jasmine RubyGem and a Jasmine rake plugin. Should be available on Google.



Why
===
It's been fun hacking on this, learnt a lot in the process. I reckon Javascript is a solid technology with a lot of potential in game development. Its only going to become faster and run on more devices, so lets just play with it!
